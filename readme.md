### A _'post it note'_ inspired web app ###
Jotter is a simple web application that allows users to store notes on the cloud.

# Features #
+ Basic editing functionality including bold, italic, underline and more.
+ User data is stored securley on the cloud using google authentication.
+ Find any text in any note using the search bar.
+ Mobile friendly so you can jot down notes on the go!

# Why Jotter? #
If you're like me, you are constantly learning and sometimes you just need to jot down a small note. A notepad is great, but I would hate to waste a full sheet of paper on small notes (save trees). Post it notes are awesome, but a cluttered desk is a cluttered mind. Mobile devices? Let's face it, that storage is filled with images and videos of our doggos. 

Jotter solves this problem by making it extremely easy to store and delete notes on the cloud. Saves you storage on your desk, machine and mobile!

# Personal Motivation #
I decided to build this app to test my skills in HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also wanted to see the difficulties involved in building an application from scratch in pure javascript in order to appreciate all the work that frameworks and libraries do for us as developers.

## Some of the challenges I faced include:  ##
+ Handling user authentication from login to logout.
+ Implementing CRUD operations with Google Firestore.
+ Organizing CSS file.

## What I learned: ##
+ Google Cloud Platform services including Auth and Firestore
+ DOM Manipulation
+ CSS B.E.M mehtodology to help make CSS more readable and manageable
+ ES6 modularity and how to share code between files

# Future improvements #
+ Remove usage of execCommand() (deprecated)
+ Add more editing features such as image uploads, code formatting and mark up parser.
+ Build user preferences and account settings page.
